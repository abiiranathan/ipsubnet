# ipsubnet

Simple library in c++ to perform subnetting.

You provide the Network ID and number of subnets you want to create from the
original network. The library will create a table with all the information
you need to sub-divide your network.

This c++ lib is ported to **web assembly** using Emscripten to power the website at [IP Subnet Demo Website](https://abiiranathan.github.io/ipsubnet).

### Warning:

This is an experiment in web assembly compilation from c++ and probably has bugs. Use at your own risk!!
